my DBMS project for 5th sem


Result Management System (Query) is the efficient handling of student results for the college faculty. 
The project aims at creating an interface for the faculty to list students matching a particular criteria with relative ease in an efficient manner

The Project database contains information about students along with thier results.Changes to the database can only be made by the Admin or a staff member with proper rights.
The project has a very attractive interface and needs no programming knowlege to use.Its search bar accepts english statements and displays the required results back immediately.
The project also comes with a Help section , to help people if they are having trouble using it
